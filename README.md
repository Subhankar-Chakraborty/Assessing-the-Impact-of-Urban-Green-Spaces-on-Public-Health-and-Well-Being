This study investigates the determinants of life expectancy in 36 Indian states and union territories
using a panel dataset spanning 1981 to 2020. Employing both fixed-effects and random-effects
regression models, we analyze the impact of healthcare infrastructure (primary health centers,
community health centers, hospitals, and hospital beds), alongside population size, forest cover, and
geographic area. A Hausman test indicates the fixed-effects model is preferred, revealing a statistically
significant positive relationship between the number of community health centers (CHCs) and life
expectancy. Our findings suggest that increasing the availability of CHCs, which provide
community-focused healthcare, plays a crucial role in improving life expectancy across diverse regions
of India. While other factors such as population size show a positive but marginal effect, the impact of
hospitals and hospital beds appears less significant within the fixed-effects framework. This research
underscores the importance of prioritizing community-based healthcare infrastructure for enhancing
population health outcomes and provides valuable insights for targeted policy interventions and
resource allocation strategies.
